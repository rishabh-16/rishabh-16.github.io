Hi I'm Rishabh Tiwari, a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google Research India. I am also a founding member and senior researcher at [Transmute AI Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmuteai/), a non profit research lab. My interest lies in the field of Deep Learning. I have worked on a variety of research problems including classification, segmentation, continual learning, network compression. My recent works revolves around developing robust and efficient machine learning systems.

I enjoy taking part in competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rishabh2001) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/rishabh-16) to diversify my domain of knowledge. Recently I became Kaggle Competitions Master by bagging a couple of silver medals in NLP competitions and a gold medal in Defect Detection Challenge.
