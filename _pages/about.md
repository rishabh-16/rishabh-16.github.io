I am a Ph.D. student in [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) at [EECS, UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Kurt Keutzer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~keutzer/), where I focus on efficient deep learning. Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/) where I worked with [Dr. Pradeep Shenoy](https://sites.google.com/site/pshenoyuw/) on developing algorithms to improve group-robustness of networks. My recent work involves mitigating simplicity bias without using bias labels, network architecture optimization by developing novel network pruning algorithm. 

I am also a founding member and senior researcher at [Transmute AI Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmuteai/), a non profit research lab, where I guide undergrad students to pursue research.
